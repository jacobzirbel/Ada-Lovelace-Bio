        Ada Lovelace is known for her work in Computer Science in the mid 19th century. 
        After being introduced to the "Analytical Engine," a theoretical machine designed to solve math problems, 
        she became facinated with how it worked.
     </p> <p>While translating an Italian article on the device 
        she came to understand it deeply and ended up writing far more than the original
    article. She wrote the algorithm that the computer would have used to calculate Bernoulli numbers,
    if the computer had ever been built. This is considered by many to be the first computer program ever written. 
     While the 
inventor of the machine mostly considered it a machine for calculating numerical operations,
she foresaw computers working on a variety of tasks.</p> </section>
